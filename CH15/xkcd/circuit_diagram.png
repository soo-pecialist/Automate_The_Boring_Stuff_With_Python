((A large and complicated circuit diagram.))

[[In the upper left corner there is a map scale, labeled with 1 mi (1 km).

Underneath the scale is an antenna symbol that leads down to a blender, an Arduino; labeled with &quot;Arduino, just for blog cred&quot;; and a chip; &quot;Most expensive chip available&quot;.

To the right of the antenna there is the symbol for an inductor that has it&#39;s lower terminal going into a the left terminal of pattern that looks like a highway cloverleaf.  The upper terminal leads to a line that is going to the upper terminal of that cloverleaf and to a battery symbol (with the + and - symbols on the wrong ends) with a value of â2V.  The right terminal of the cloverleaf is going into a resistor symbol label &quot;120Î© or to taste&quot;.  Connected to the other terminals of the resistor and battery is a switch that is labeled &quot;glue open&quot;.  The bottom of the two lines has a transistor with two emitters, one P and one N, and no collector.  The P-type emitter is connected to the top line and a jar of scarab beetles.  Above the beetles is a resistor labeled &quot;brown blue orange&quot;. To the right is an unlabeled resistor with a center tap going into a capacitor, with a ground on the other end.  Above the capacitor is a diode, and below an inductor.  To the right is another inductor.  The two inductors and ground are all covered by a &quot;solder blob&quot;.  The rightmost component is a &quot;666 timer&quot; that has pin 5 going into a question mark.

Back to the left side, below and to the left of the cloverleaf is a compass rose.  The bottom terminal of the cloverleaf is connected to a battery, labeled 50V, with grounds on both sides.  To the right of the battery is a long horizontal wire that is labeled &quot;pull this wire really tight.&quot;  That wire is hooked up to a vertical wire that connects to the N-type emitter of the transistor above it.  To the right is an AC source that is labeled 240V, shorted out, with a label on the short &quot;omit this if you&#39;re a wimp.&quot;  To the right of that is an inductor that is labeled with &quot;11kg&quot;, a batman symbol, and a squirrel.

Back to the left end of the diagram, where the blender is, there is a wire that is labeled as a distance 3
8&quot; from the wire with the 50V battery.  To the right there is a frowny face, then a vertical wire with a 90 degree bend labeled &quot;caution â±&quot;.  That leads into a balloon.  Under the balloon is an inductor symbol with a line on the bottom edge labeled as &quot;warm front&quot;.

Underneath the blender and to the right of the Arduino is a resistor labeled &quot;ë&quot;.  To the right is an electric eel, a capacitor, an unlabeled resistor, and a gob of hot glue attached to a chip with an inverter hooked to an XOR gate, both with feedback into each other.  Under the electric eel is a neck strap.  To the right of the XOR gate and inverter is a bridge rectifier labeled as &quot;Moral rectifier&quot;  to the right again is a bottle of magic smoke, under that a fishing bobber and then a broken wire labeled with a question mark. 

Under the most expensive chip available there is a vertical wire labeled with &quot;electrons single file&quot;.  To the right is a switch labeled &quot;hire someone to open and close switch real fast.&quot;  To the right of that is a contact labeled &quot;touche tongue here&quot;.  Below that is a resistor labeled &quot;5Î© (decoy)&quot; with only one terminal connected.  To the right of the contact is a methyl group attchaed to a wire.  To the right of the methyl group is a complex mesh of 1Î© resistors labeled with &quot;oh, so you think you&#39;re such a whiz at EE201?&quot;

Connected to the wire labeled &quot;electrons single file&quot; is a wire bent in a U shape with an upside-down ground on the end.  To the right is a flux capacitor with the bottom wire labeled I-95.  To the right of that is a wire labeled yarn, then an arena with two diodes going in and one leaving.  The right diode has a ground on its anode labeled &quot;bury deep, but not too deep.&quot;  To the right of that is a motor labeled vibrator, resistor with a value of Ï, and a 500V AC source.

Under the flux capacitor is a wire that leads out of frame with a label &quot;â to center of sun&quot;.  To the right is a 55 MPH speed limit sign, then an SR latch (flip-flop) labeled &quot;may use an actual sandal instead&quot;.  Connected to the Q of the SR latch is a holding pen and to the inverting Q output is a wire in a knot, a resistor labeled &quot;8mm&quot;, a resistor symbol labeled &quot;not a resistor; wire just does this&quot;, and a motor symbol labeled &quot;to scale&quot;.

Under the wire that leads off to the center of the sun is a tangled mess of wires connected and jumping over each other, then a photo diode labeled &quot;tear collector&quot;.  Under the tear collector is a wire in the shape of a ECG.  To the right is a light bulb, a capacitor-looking symbol labeled 3 liters, a resistor labeled yes, an unlabeled inductor, a resistor with a question mark as a label.  To the right of all that is an inductor labeled &quot;take off shirt while wiring this part.  Ooh, yeah, I like that.&quot;  Finally, in the lower right hand corner is a ground symbol immersed in a beaker of holy water.]]</div>
